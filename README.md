Hey y'all

My name is @Darkosxl and I'm interested in software development, artificial intelligence, and most importantly video game design. 
This is the continuation of my old account @darkwarro, whose e-mail was corrupted (The projects I was able to recover were transported here). I'm a college student studying CS currently and am learning python and C for machine learning. I've been developing prototypes of games on unity and java (without an engine) for a couple years now, and would love to collaborate on prototypes/full projects for any genre of games.
